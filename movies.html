<p>Some of my all-time favorite movies are Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Star Wars: A New Hope, and The Empire Strikes Back. I love each of these films for different reasons - I like Terminator 2 for its amazing action, A new hope for its characters and captivating story and I like monty python and the holy grail for its amazing comedy.</p>
